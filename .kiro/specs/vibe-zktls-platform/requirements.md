# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Vibe zkTLS is a comprehensive creator platform that leverages zero-knowledge Transport Layer Security (zkTLS) technology for privacy-preserving identity verification and token distribution. The platform enables creators to verify their social media accounts, earn reputation scores, create personal tokens, and participate in an automated content reward system. Built on Monad testnet, it combines blockchain technology with privacy-preserving verification to create a secure and transparent creator economy.
